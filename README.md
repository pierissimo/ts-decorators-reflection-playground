# kickstart-node-typescript
A standardised project to let OneFlow developers quickly kickstart a new TypeScript Node project

This setup includes
- Sample class with sync and async code
- Unit tests for class
- Tslint Eslint and editorconfig configuration
- CircleCI build configuration
- Docker build configuration
- NPM configuration 

It includes some developer conventions:
- Tslint based on Microsoft with a few overrides
- Eslint based on Airbnb with a few overrides (thus, runs on codeclimate)
- Editorconfig to match tslint/eslint

## Run, Testing, Coverage

To start:
```
npm start
```

To start on production:
```
npm run build
```

To test:
```
npm test
```

To run coverage:
```
npm run cover
```

## Building

This can build on CircleCI. The `circle.yml` script includes everything necessary. 
The only exception is that you need to set up the CircleCI SSH key to enable write access
to your github repository. 

More info can be found in the [Oneflow's Wiki](https://oneflow.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/CircleCI)

Environment variables required:
- CODECOV_TOKEN: to enable pushing coverage to codecov.io
- NPM_TOKEN: to enable use of private @oneflow npms, and publishing to npm
- DOCKER_USER: to push a docker image
- DOCKER_PASS: to push a docker image
- DOCKER_EMAIL: to push a docker image

## QA WebTools
